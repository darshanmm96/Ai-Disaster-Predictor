# AI Disaster Predictor 🌍

An AI-based web application designed to predict potential natural disasters using climate-related parameters and provide early awareness to users.

## Features
- Disaster prediction interface
- Climate awareness dashboard
- Multiple disaster scenarios (Cyclone, Tsunami, Thunderstorm, Tornado)
- User-friendly and responsive design

## Technologies Used
- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript (Basic logic)

## Project Structure
- `index.html` – Home page
- `tracker.html` – Disaster tracking module
- `predictor.html` – AI prediction interface

## How It Works
The system takes climate-related inputs and processes them using predefined logic to estimate the likelihood of natural disasters.  
(This is a prototype representing AI-based prediction concepts.)

## Future Enhancements
- Integration with real-time weather APIs
- Machine learning model integration
- Live alerts and notifications
- Cloud deployment
